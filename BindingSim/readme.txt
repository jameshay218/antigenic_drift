We will write 3 kinds of documents: User requirements, System design and Specifications for codes.

A.User requirements
It serves as user requirement. Will be written in latex format in a research proposal style.

B.System Design
Only describes the concept for flow from proposal.

C.Specification for codes:
Analysis/Flow. It describes the physical location of the files, flow of the algorithms at the system level
Object Design. It describes the flow at the object level. Also, the design of the object, array or the relationship of the objects.
Documents for code. Write more detailed description in matlab files.



1. Proposal -> a.BindingSim/doc/immunehistory b.BindingSim/doc/netcharge
2. System design -> Binding/doc/design/BindingSimX_SystemDesign
3. Analysis/flow -> BindingAvidity/mat/Mbindingavidity/doc/BindingSimX_SystemFlow
4. Object Design -> BindingAvidity/mat/Mbindingavidity/doc/BindingSimX_Object
5. Documents for code -> each m files
