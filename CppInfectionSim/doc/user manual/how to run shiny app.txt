The steps to run shiny app

1. Clone the github repository
2. Once you have all of the files, go into the CppInfectionSim/driftSim folder
3. In R, install the "shiny" package
4. There is a subfolder of the R package, "inst/shiny-examples/driftSimApp". Go into this folder in R and then type the following command: shiny::runApp(). This should run the simulation shiny app. If it doesn't work there are likely some dependency issues or compiler issues - you will have to address these yourself I'm afraid, as everything works as intended on my linux machine at home.
